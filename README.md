# Slack Grocery Bot
## Spring Boot application to manage and automate weekly grocery orders through Slack.
Leverages the Slack Web API alongside Spring MVC
REST controllers for order intake, implements custom Slack slash commands,
interactive UI, uses Javaâ€™s regex for
parsing free-form message text, and relies on Jackson
for JSON payload handling. Timed operations are
handled by Spring Scheduling. Testing with JUnit & Mockito.
### In progress: DB, adding deployment pipelines for staging and production, LLM API integration.
